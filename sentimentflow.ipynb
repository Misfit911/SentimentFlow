    "## 1.1. Overview + Background\n",
    "The world today is rife with information flowing from millions of users across different platforms based on a variety of topics including politics, celebrities, data science, wordle, and exercise to make my brain bigger. These opinions on the web garner more and more traffic and gain traction. At the same time, this information reaches a much larger audience who may also share the same information with their networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is a machine learning technology that gives computers the ability to interpret, manipulate, and comprehend human language. This would be very useful in analysing human made opinions on the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "These sentiments across the internet can be analysed using Natural Language Processing methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every company/ business with an online presence, and even ones without, require some form of observing, recording, tracking and analysing of these online opinions of their products or services to insure their business public image and ensure that opinions on the web do not burn the palettes of their users, and especially those of the potential users of their products or services, so to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Problem Statement\n",
    "With such a large volume of information shared by and / or received from many users and potential users, business would not be able to keep up with the information received if they attempt to track everything, everywhere all at once, manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without fully comprehending the effects of the publics opinion, the businesses' public image could be tarnished. The poor public image could lead to potentially market share losses, loss of trust from it's repeat consumers, low credibility to its potential clients and also loss of investment/ partnership opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Proposed Solution\n",
    "To address this situation, a major mobile vendor reached out to us at **SentimentFlow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "SentimentFlow leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques to analyze sentiment in textual data, providing valuable insights for decision-making by the management of the vendor.The analysis would be used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing the public opinion would help businesses monitor their brand and sentiments around their products and services coming in as customer feedback, and understand customer needs, while preventing poor public relations.\n",

    "You are required build an NLP model to analyze Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. The dataset comes from CrowdFlower via data.world. Human raters rated the sentiment in over 9,000 Tweets as positive, negative, or neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aim for a Proof of Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches to NLP problems - start with something simple and iterate from there. For example, you could start by limiting your analysis to positive and negative Tweets only, allowing you to build a binary classifier. Then you could add in the neutral Tweets to build out a multiclass classifier. You may also consider using some of the more advanced NLP methods in the Mod 4 Appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating multiclass classifiers can be trickier than binary classifiers because there are multiple ways to mis-classify an observation, and some errors are more problematic than others. Use the business problem that your NLP project sets out to solve to inform your choice of evaluation metrics."
