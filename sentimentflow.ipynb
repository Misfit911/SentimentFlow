    "## 1. **Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SentimentFlow aims to address a real-world problem related to understanding public sentiment towards Apple and Google products on Twitter. The stakeholders include companies, marketing teams, and decision-makers who want to gauge public opinion and make informed strategic decisions based on social media sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets related to Apple and Google products. We want to determine whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This classification can help companies understand customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and tailor their responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Companies (Apple and Google):** These organizations are directly impacted by public sentiment. They want to monitor how their products are perceived and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Marketing Teams:** Marketing teams can use sentiment analysis to adjust their campaigns, respond to negative feedback, and highlight positive aspects of their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision-Makers:** Executives and managers need insights into public sentiment to make informed decisions about product development, customer support, and brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Proposition\n",
    "\n",
    "By accurately classifying tweets, our NLP model can provide actionable insights to stakeholders. For example:\n",
    "- Identifying negative sentiment can help companies address issues promptly.\n",
    "- Recognizing positive sentiment can guide marketing efforts and reinforce successful strategies.\n",
    "- Understanding neutral sentiment can provide context and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "> To develop a NLP (Natural Language Processing) multiclass classification model for sentiment analysis, aim to achieve a recall score of 85% and an accuracy of 90%. The model should categorize sentiments into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* To idenitfy the most common words used in the dataset using Word cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To confirm the most common words that are positively and negatively tagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To recognize the products that have been opined by the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To spot the distribution of the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our NLP model will contribute valuable insights to the real-world problem of understanding Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. Stakeholders can leverage this information to enhance their decision-making processes and improve overall customer satisfaction."

    "## 2. **Data Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "The dataset originates from CrowdFlower via data.world. Contributors evaluated tweets related to various brands and products. Specifically:\n",
    "- Each tweet was labeled as expressing positive, negative, or no emotion toward a brand or product.\n",
    "- If emotion was expressed, contributors specified which brand or product was the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability of Data\n",
    "Here's why this dataset is suitable for our project:\n",
    "1. **Relevance:** The data directly aligns with our business problem of understanding Twitter sentiment for Apple and Google products.\n",
    "2. **Real-World Context:** The tweets represent actual user opinions, making the problem relevant in practice.\n",
    "3. **Multiclass Labels:** We can build both binary (positive/negative) and multiclass (positive/negative/neutral) classifiers using this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Size\n",
    "The dataset contains over 9,000 labeled tweets. We'll explore its features to gain insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- **tweet_text:** The content of each tweet.\n",
    "- **is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product:** No emotion toward brand or product, Positive emotion, Negative emotion, I can't tell\n",
    "- **emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at:** The brand or product mentioned in the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Inclusion\n",
    "Tweet text is the primary feature. The emotion label and target brand/product are essential for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Label Noise:** Human raters' subjectivity may introduce noise.\n",
    "- **Imbalanced Classes:** We'll address class imbalance during modeling.\n",
    "- **Contextual Challenges:** Tweets are often short and context-dependent.\n",
    "- **Incomplete & Missing Data:** Could affect the overall performance of the models."
